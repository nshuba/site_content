# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Mobile devices play an essential role in the Internet today, and there is an increasing interest in using them as a vantage point for network measurement from the edge. At the same time, these devices store personal, sensitive information, and there is a growing number of applications that leak it. We propose AntMonitor – the first system of its kind that supports (i) collection of large-scale, semantic-rich network traffic in a way that respects users’ privacy preferences and (ii) detection and prevention of leakage of private information in real time. The first property makes AntMonitor a powerful tool for network researchers who want to collect and analyze large-scale yet fine-grained mobile measurements. The second is an incentive for using AntMonitor and contributing data."
