I am an R&D Engineer at [Broadcom](https://www.broadcom.com/) by day and an Independent Researcher by night.
Currently, I am collaborating with researchers at the University of Oxford and the University of California, Irvine to analyze privacy aspects of various mobile and IoT devices.
During my Ph.D, I was the lead developer in the [AntMonitor](http://antmonitor.calit2.uci.edu) and [NoMoAds](http://athinagroup.eng.uci.edu/projects/nomoads/) projects.
